# D0036E, Programming for Machine Learning, Lp1, H23 - Lab 01

> In this lab, we will begin by working with data to calculate fundamental statistics. Next, you will develop a data
> loader to import a real dataset. Utilizing the functions you have created, you will gain valuable insights from the
> dataset and generate data plots for visualization purposes.
> The data to be used is available in Canvas and shows information about different housing districts. The name of the
> file is housing.csv.
> Note that in addition to the Tasks described below the following exercises in the course book are mandatory for
> completing this lab (Chapter-Exercise): 3-2, 5-3, 8-4, 10-6, 10-7.
